## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- In Oracle layers, columns are now sorted by name

### Fixed

- Fixed queries with multiple filters
- Fixed a bug that prevented to add new columns to existing reports

### Removed

- Removed deprecated JDBC connector for Oracle

- Removed the datasource parameter 'packetsize', which was not used

## [1.1.1] - 2019-07-12

### Changed

- JDBC connector for Oracle have been deprecated and will be removed in the
  next version

  It is not tested, requires several build dependencies (openjdk, g++, make)
  and there is already an Oracle connector that works and is supported by knex.

- Connector for Google BigQuery have been deprecated and will be removed in the
  next version

  It is not tested, depends on an old non-maintained package, which itself
  depends on packages that have security issues.
  It might be reintroduced in the future though, if someone is willing to
  implement it using packages that do not have these problems

### Fixed

- Fixed an infinite $digest look when editing a report
- Fixed a weird bug where sometimes a click in layers/reports/dashboards list
  would do nothing
