"Import layers, reports, dashboards

Usage:
    cli import [options...] [<file>]

<file> should be a JSON file generated by Urungi export tool.
If <file> is - or if there is no <file>, standard input is read.

Available options:
    --datasource-map=<from>:<to>
        Replace \`datasourceID\` in imported layers.

        This is useful if you want to import layers from another Urungi instance
        that doesn't have the same datasources.

        <from> should be a datasource id existing in <file>, or '*' to replace
        all \`datasourceID\`.

        <to> should be a datasource id existing in the Urungi database

        This option is repeatable.
        If this option is given multiple times, and <from> is '*' in one of
        them, it acts as a fallback.

    --overwrite
        By default, if a layer/report/dashboard in the import file also exists
        in Urungi database, it will not be imported.

        Enabling this option will overwrite the existing layers, reports and
        dashboards with the ones in <file>

Examples:

    cli import --datasource-map=5e18537d852fdfb9f0f9a777:5e18538872b444e87d0053d1 \\\\
        --datasource-map=*:5e1853a1aa2814a2b33a9080 export.json

    This will replace all \`datasourceID\` in layers by:
      - 5e18538872b444e87d0053d1 if \`datasourceID\` is 5e18537d852fdfb9f0f9a777
      - 5e1853a1aa2814a2b33a9080 otherwise
    and create new layers/reports/dashboards. Those who already exists in
    database will not be replaced.
