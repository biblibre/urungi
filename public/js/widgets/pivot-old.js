transform the json data into a multidimensional array like Pandas, then create the grid

columns
sex

rows
city

we need to identify the different values for sex
this is male and female,
in a array

after identify the values for the columns
for every row (city, we need to identify the values of the metric)

we have to iterate using the results json , the results json includes the sex, city and the measure

D3.js has the function nest  para agregar los datos y agruparlos...

pivot.js

for every row in results
 for (var r in results)
 {
     for (

 }

for (var i in sex)
{

}
